# Selfbound

Selfbound is a dungeon crawler where you fight past versions of yourself. Every enemy is a copy of how you played in previous runs, so you must adapt and outsmart your own past strategies. 

## How to play
- Earn coins by defeating enemies.
- Buy upgrades with coins to get stronger, although enemies will mimic your strength.
- Complete the game by beating the final boss!

## Controls
- WASD: Move around
- Mouse Hover: Aim
- Space: Shoot
- Other Keys: Activate abilities (specific mappings may vary)
